# GoogleHierarchy
A Google App Script for generating a document which shows all files in folder based organization. 

It works by creating a Google Document in the user's root directory which is then populated with the information about the files inside. I am still learning about the usage of attribute in Google App Script files, but I think this is one of the more simple ways to deal with bold fonts, however some commands are repetitive.
